# StockWatcher
My first official iOS app. The idea is to more effectively automate how to tell when to buy stocks. In spending several
years trying to find an app that tracks the cost of a stock using common indicators, I've yet to find something that 
goes with my attitude of trading: know when the "buy low" point is (which is always determinable) as well as the "sell high."

## Strategy
Simply put, some energy will be spent getting this app off the ground as I'm finishing off my Big Nerd Ranch projects.

Here's how it will go:

1. Mock-up the flow: Nail down an overall flow of how the app will act. Nothing too complicated at this point; need to get to
MVP.
2. Mock-up the screens: Same as flow, except that here we're going to put some skin on the frame.
3. Translate mock-ups to Xcode: Get the designs on controllers.
4. Code, test, fix (which really means research times ten thousand), repeat: Get the app up and running.
5. Ship: Once stable, submit the app to Apple's App Store.

Nothing too ambitious, eh? :)
